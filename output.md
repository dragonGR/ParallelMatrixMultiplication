# Understanding the Output

This document explains the output generated by the multithreaded matrix multiplication program. The program outputs three matrices: the input matrices \( A \) and \( B \), and the resultant matrix \( C \) which is the product of \( A \) and \( B \).

## Matrix A
Matrix \( A \) is the first input matrix. It is dynamically allocated and filled with random values for demonstration purposes. This matrix is displayed to show its contents before the multiplication process begins.

## Matrix B
Matrix \( B \) is the second input matrix. Like matrix \( A \), it is dynamically allocated and filled with random values. This matrix is also displayed before the multiplication to show its initial state.

## Resultant Matrix C
Matrix \( C \) is the output of the matrix multiplication \( A \times B \). Each element \( C_{i,j} \) in this matrix is the dot product of the \( i \)-th row of \( A \) and the \( j \)-th column of \( B \). It is calculated using the following formula:

\[ C_{i,j} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{i,k} \times B_{k,j} \]

where \( n \) is the number of columns in \( A \) and the number of rows in \( B \).

### Example Output Breakdown

Here's an example output to illustrate:

```plaintext

Matrix A:
 4.00  7.00  1.00  6.00 
 5.00  9.00  3.00  4.00 
 2.00  8.00  7.00  2.00 
 1.00  0.00  9.00  5.00 

Matrix B:
 3.00  6.00  4.00  7.00 
 2.00  1.00  5.00  9.00 
 8.00  3.00  0.00  6.00 
 7.00  4.00  8.00  2.00 

Resultant Matrix C:
 77.00  51.00  68.00  99.00 
 83.00  65.00  66.00 109.00 
 85.00  45.00  54.00 108.00 
102.00  57.00  17.00  71.00 
```

- Matrix A shows the values in the first matrix:

 5.00  9.00  3.00  4.00 
 2.00  8.00  7.00  2.00 
 1.00  0.00  9.00  5.00 
```

- Matrix B shows the values in the second matrix:
```plaintext
 3.00  6.00  4.00  7.00 
 2.00  1.00  5.00  9.00 
 8.00  3.00  0.00  6.00 
 7.00  4.00  8.00  2.00 
```

- Resultant Matrix C shows the product of matrices AA and BB:
```plaintext
77.00  51.00  68.00  99.00 
83.00  65.00  66.00 109.00

102.00 57.00 17.00 71.00
```

### What They Show

- **Matrix A and Matrix B**: These are the randomly generated input matrices used in the multiplication. Displaying them helps verify that the matrices were correctly generated and populated with values.
- **Resultant Matrix C**: This is the result of multiplying matrices \( A \) and \( B \). Each element in \( C \) confirms the correct computation of the matrix multiplication using the multithreaded approach. Displaying this matrix demonstrates the successful execution of the algorithm and the correctness of the implementation.

By examining these matrices, users can understand the input data, follow the computation process, and verify the correctness of the output produced by the program.
